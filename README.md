# developer-profile-generator

## Overview

For this project, I've created a command-line application that dynamically generates a PDF profile from a GitHub username.The application will be invoked with the following command:

```sh
node index.js
```
The user will be prompted for a favorite color, which will be then be used as the background color for cards.
